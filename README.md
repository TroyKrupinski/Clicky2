*-------HOW TO USE CLICKY-------*
How to use the multiple buttons:
The buttons clicky, clicky2, clicky3 and clicky 4 correspond to your main directory, folder 1, 2 and 3 respectfully. (arrays ar[], ar2[], ar3[] and ar4[]).

Once the buttons are clicked, a random file will be selected from the array (your folder(s)).

The Back and Forward buttons are to scrub through the files you've already played.

The Repeat is a toggleable button makes it so that no files repeat in each folder / directory. 

The Clear button clears both the Repeat cache and the Back / Forward cache.

The Replay button replays the current SWF / file.

The Reset button resets the player back to the starting image.
